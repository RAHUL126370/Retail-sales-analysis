# Retail-sales-analysis

This project focuses on analyzing monthly sales data to gain insights into sales trends, performance, and patterns over time. The analysis is conducted using Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks, providing both automated data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
1. clean.py: This script handles data cleaning processes such as removing missing values, correcting data types, and preparing the data for analysis.
2. main.py: The main script that orchestrates the entire analysis process. It calls the data cleaning functions and performs the core analysis, generating results and visualizations.
3. monthlysales.csv: The dataset containing monthly sales records used for analysis.
4.  monthlysales.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook that provides an interactive environment for conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizing trends, and further refining the analysis.
5.  analysis.py: This script handles analysis processes such as creating new columns from existing columns and maintain data for further analysis.

 The analysis provide insights into sales performance over time, helping identify key trends, seasonal patterns, and any potential areas of concern or opportunity.
